The original idea for a podium made of block in a NestrisChamps logo comes from [fur_of_kitten](https://www.twitch.tv/fur_of_kitten).

Adding a pixel art trophy is an idea from [XeaL](https://github.com/alex-ong).

The pixel art trophy comes from [this package on itch.io](https://vsioneithr.itch.io/trophy-cups-pixel-pack) and was purchased on 2021/08/07 by [timotheeg](https://github.com/timotheeg)/[yobi9](https://www.twitch.tv/yobi9). Check other projects by **Vsio NeithR** on their [itch.io page](https://vsioneithr.itch.io/).

The final assembly of the logo components is done by [timotheeg](https://github.com/timotheeg)/[yobi9](https://www.twitch.tv/yobi9).
